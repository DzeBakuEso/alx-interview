## Description
This project focuses on algorithm development using Python to determine whether all boxes in a list can be opened using keys found within the boxes. This problem models a real-world challenge of navigating through connected nodes and is a classic test of your understanding of data structures, recursion, and graph traversal.

## Task

### `0-lockboxes.py` (Mandatory)

#### Problem Statement:
You have `n` locked boxes, each numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The first box `boxes[0]` is unlocked and may contain keys to other boxes. Each key is a number that opens the corresponding box.

#### Function Prototype:
```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes):
