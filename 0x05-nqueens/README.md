# 0x05. N Queens

## üìå Project Overview

The **N Queens** problem is a classic algorithmic challenge that requires placing `N` non-attacking queens on an `N√óN` chessboard. A queen can attack horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, so the challenge is to find all valid board configurations where no two queens threaten each other.

This project focuses on solving the N Queens problem using a **backtracking algorithm** in **Python**. You are required to write a program that accepts an integer `N` (where `N >= 4`) from the command line and outputs all possible solutions.

## üìñ Concepts You Need to Know

- **Backtracking Algorithm**:
  - A recursive technique to build solutions incrementally, removing those that fail to satisfy the problem constraints.

- **Recursion in Python**:
  - Essential to implement the backtracking logic.

- **List Manipulations**:
  - Used to maintain queen positions on the board.

- **Command-Line Arguments**:
  - Parsing input with the `sys` module.
