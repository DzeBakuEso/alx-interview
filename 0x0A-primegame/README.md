## Description
Maria and Ben are playing a competitive game using a set of consecutive integers. For each round, players remove a prime number and all its multiples from the set. The game continues until no prime numbers are left. The player who cannot make a move loses.

You are to determine the winner of each round over multiple games and return the name of the player who wins the most rounds.

This project assesses your understanding of:
- Prime numbers
- Game theory
- Dynamic programming
- Algorithm optimization using Python

## Concepts to Know

### Prime Numbers
- Definition and identification of prime numbers
- Efficient algorithms for finding primes

### Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Optimal method for generating prime numbers up to a limit
- Key for performance in repeated rounds

### Game Theory
- Turn-based strategy logic
- Optimal play and decision-making

### Dynamic Programming / Memoization
- Caching computations for efficiency in repeated evaluations

### Python Programming
- Control structures (loops, conditions)
- List manipulation and performance-conscious coding

## Requirements

### General
- Use only `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs` editors
- Files interpreted with Python 3.4.3 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All Python files must:
  - End with a new line
  - Begin with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - Follow PEP 8 (version 1.7.x)
  - Be executable
- A `README.md` file is mandatory

## Tasks

### 0. Prime Game (Mandatory)

#### Function Prototype:
```python
def isWinner(x, nums)
