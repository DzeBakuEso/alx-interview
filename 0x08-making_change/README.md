## 0x08. Making Change

### ðŸ“š Project Overview

This project is a classic exploration of the **coin change problem**, where the goal is to determine the minimum number of coins required to make up a given amount using a set of coin denominations. It is a common algorithmic challenge that tests your understanding of **dynamic programming**, **greedy algorithms**, and **optimization strategies**.
